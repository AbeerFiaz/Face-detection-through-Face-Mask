Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked research into automated monitoring technology to support public health measures, such as enforcing face-mask compliance. Face-mask detection has become a key area in computer vision, combining deep learning, real-time image analysis, and edge computing. This project aims to develop a face-mask detection system using deep learning while examining how effectively the models can run on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. The Jetson Nano was chosen because it is low-power and a compact platform for embedded AI.
